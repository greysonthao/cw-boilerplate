## CW-Boilerplate

For my boilerplate, I created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game including unit tests, integration tests, and CosmWasmJS for uploading, instantiating, executing, and querying the smart contract. I like having the extra details in the contract because it gives me reference for how the smart contract should look like.
